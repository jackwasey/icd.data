#' @param verbose single logical value, defaults to \code{FALSE} in most
#'   settings, based on the default value of the option. Verbose output may be
#'   set for the R session using \code{options(icd.data.verbose = TRUE)}.
#'   Furthermore, for some functions, setting the verbosity to an integer
#'   greater than one will give more verbosity. This is primarily for
#'   development.
