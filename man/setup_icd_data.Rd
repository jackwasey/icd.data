\title{Set up the data download cache, give permission to download data}
\usage{
setup_icd_data(path = NULL)

icd_data_dir(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to a directory where cached online raw and parsed data will be cached. It will be created if it doesn't exist.}
}
\value{
The path to the resource directory, or \code{NULL} if it could not be
  found.

Invisibly returns the data path which was set, or NULL if not done.
}
\description{
This must be called by the user, as prompted on package attach with \code{library(icd.data)}. \code{icd.data} is a dependency (not an import) of \code{icd}, so that \code{icd} can function more smoothly, avoiding prompting during commands, although this should still be possible, and will happen if the user initially declines permission to download and cache data.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{icd_data_dir}: Return the currently active data directory. If
missing, it will return \code{NULL} and, depending on
\code{getOption("icd.data.absent_action")}, will stop, give a message, or
do nothing.
