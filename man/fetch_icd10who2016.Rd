\description{
This will download the latest ICD-10 codes and descriptions from the WHO, and
save the results in a directory given by \code{icd.data:::get_resource_path()}.
This defaults to a subdirectory \code{.icd.data} of the home directory. This is
necessary because it is not permitted to write data back to the installed
package location (and this may not be allowed on a multi-user system,
anyway).
