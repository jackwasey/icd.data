Description: ICD-9 and ICD-10 definitions from the United States
    Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are included in this
    package. A function is provided to extract the WHO ICD-10 definitions
    from the public interface, but the data themselves may not currently
    be redistributed. There are diagnostic and procedure codes, and lists
    of the chapter and sub-chapter headings and the ranges of ICD codes
    they encompass. There are also two sets of sample patient data with
    ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes representing real patients and spanning common
    structures of patient data. Much of the data is downloaded and parsed
    on demand. This can all be done at once, or piecemeal as data is used.
    These data are used by the 'icd' package for finding comorbidities and
    working with ICD codes.
