Description: ICD-9 and ICD-10 definitions from the United States
    Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are included in this
    package. A function is provided to extract the WHO ICD-10 definitions
    from the public interface, but the data themselves may not currently
    be redistributed.  The function 'fetch_icd10who2016()' should be run once
    after installing this package. There are diagnostic and procedure
    codes, and lists of the chapter and sub-chapter headings and the
    ranges of ICD codes they encompass. There are also two sets of sample
    patient data with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes representing real patients
    and spanning common structures of patient data. These data are used by
    the 'icd' package for finding comorbidities and working with ICD
    codes.
