Description: ICD-9 and ICD-10 definitions from the United States
    Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are included in this
    package. A function is provided to extract the WHO definition from
    their public interface, but it may not currently be redistributed.
    This function 'fetch_icd10_who' should be run once after installing
    this package. There are diagnostic and procedure codes, and lists of
    the chapter and sub-chapter headings and the ranges of ICD codes they
    encompass.  There are also two small and one large data samples
    representing real patients and spanning common structures of patient
    data. These data are used by the 'icd' package for finding
    comorbidities and working with ICD codes.
